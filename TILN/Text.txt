Achieving challenging goals – such as school success – requires
willingness to control impulses and work hard, as well as the ability to manage emotions associated with goal pursuit. While it is
clear that academic achievement is predicted by intellectual abilities (Poropat, 2009), it is less clear what is the predictive power of
psychological attributes at the intersection of emotions, cognition
and self-regulation. Conscientiousness – a personality trait that
primarily describes impulse control and self-regulation of behavior
(John, Naumann, & Soto, 2008) – has been consistently related to
academic achievement (Poropat, 2009). In this paper we test
another two proposed predictors of school success – Grit and
Emotion Regulation Ability (ERA). Grit is a lower-level personality
trait in the domain of Conscientiousness (Duckworth, Peterson,
Matthews, & Kelly, 2007). Both Conscientiousness and Grit
describe typical everyday performance or behavior (how people
generally behave). By contrast, ERA is an ability to reason about
effectiveness of different emotion regulation strategies and
describes maximal capacity for solving emotion-related problems
(Brackett, Rivers, & Salovey, 2011). While both self-regulation
traits (such as Conscientiousness and Grit) and ERA predict important outcomes (Brackett et al., 2011; Duckworth et al., 2007;
Roberts, Walton, & Bogg, 2005), they are only modestly and
inconsistently correlated to each other (e.g., Day & Carroll, 2004;
Lopes, Salovey, & Straus, 2003; Lopes et al., 2004).
Conscientiousness is the Big Five trait that ‘‘describes socially
prescribed impulse control that facilitates task- and goal-related
behavior’’ (p. 120, John et al., 2008). As a super-trait, Conscientiousness includes a number of lower-level traits or facets, such
as self-control and perseverance (e.g., MacCann, Duckworth, &
Roberts, 2009; Roberts, Chernyshenko, Stark, & Goldberg, 2005).
Grit is a noncognitive personality trait involving persistence and
long-term consistency of interests (Duckworth et al., 2007). As
such, Grit is conceptually closely related to Conscientiousness; persistence, a major component of Grit has been identified as one of
the facets of Conscientiousness in multiple studies (e.g., Hough &
Ones, 2001; MacCann et al., 2009). Conscientiousness emerged as
the personality trait most consistently and strongly correlated to
academic success (Poropat, 2009), and initial studies of Grit
showed relationships to various measures of academic achievement (Duckworth & Quinn, 2009; Duckworth et al., 2007).
In contrast to the personality traits of Conscientiousness and
Grit, ERA is an ability (a component of emotional intelligence;
Mayer & Salovey, 1997) and describes individual’s maximal capacity to evaluate emotion regulation strategies and to influence one’s
affective experience and actions in ways that promote goal attainment in emotionally charged situations (e.g., presence of competing goals, experience of challenges or obstacles). This ability is
distinct from personality traits describing a tendency toward positive or negative emotions (i.e., Extraversion and Neuroticism;
Mayer, Roberts, & Barsade, 2008) and rather describes the capacity
to reason about a variety of emotions. The present study aims to

examine the independent predictive power of Conscientiousness,
Grit, and ERA in relation to measures of high school success.
1.1. Conscientiousness and Grit in prediction of school success
Conscientiousness is a super-trait that encompasses a family of
lower-level traits in the broad domain of self-regulation (John
et al., 2008; Roberts, Lejuez, Krueger, Richards, & Hill, 2014). Analyses of trait adjectives and personality inventories define a range of
lower-level Conscientiousness-related traits, with five traits identified in multiple studies: orderliness, self-control, industriousness,
responsibility, and traditionalism (Roberts et al., 2014). Two most
common traits are orderliness and industriousness (Roberts et al.,
2014). Orderliness can be defined as ‘‘the overarching tendency
to be prepared’’ (p. 1317, Roberts et al., 2014), which includes a
predisposition toward neatness and planfulness, while industriousness describes a predisposition to be hard-working and persistent in the face of obstacles (Roberts et al., 2014). Developmental
precursors of Conscientiousness, such as childhood impulsivity
and delay of gratification, further support the conceptualization
of Conscientiousness as a self-regulation trait (Roberts et al., 2014).
Conscientiousness is most commonly assessed using self-report
inventories that ask about typical or average behavioral tendencies
and preferences (e.g., tendency to be generally reliable and hardworking, liking order; John et al., 2008). Different personality
inventories are based on different theoretical perspectives and
thus assess a range of facets, but no single inventory assesses the
whole breadth of the Conscientiousness domain (Roberts et al.,
2014). Despite the imperfect correspondence in the facets
measured by the various Big Five inventories, there is very strong
convergence between Conscientiousness domain scores across
measures (John et al., 2008), suggesting that these inventories adequately estimate a person’s position on the broad trait domain.
Conscientiousness is correlated with a variety of behaviors that
require planning and self-control of behavior, such as smoking,
excessive alcohol use, drug use, and violence (Roberts, Chernyshenko,
et al., 2005; Roberts, Walton, et al., 2005). Furthermore, Conscientiousness is consistently related to school success across age
and level of schooling, and largely independent of general intelligence (Poropat, 2009). Conscientiousness predicts school success
across cultures (e.g., U.S.: Noftle & Robins, 2007; Estonia: Laidra,
Pullmann, & Allik, 2007; Croatia: Bratko, Chamorro-Premuzic, &
Saks, 2006) and it predicts achievement over tutors’ expectations
of performance (Chamorro-Premuzic & Furnham, 2003) and prior
achievement (Noftle & Robins, 2007).
Research suggests that both broad and lower-level traits predict
important outcomes and that lower-level traits can be even more
powerful predictors than broad traits (O’Connor and Paunonen,
2007). Roberts, Chernyshenko, et al. (2005) found that lower-level
Conscientiousness facets had differential relationship with important criteria, such as work dedication and drug use, and that
using these lower-level scales improved criterion validity over
the use of broad trait measures. Similarly, when predicting
academic achievement, several studies found the Achievement
Striving facet of Conscientiousness to be more highly correlated
with academic achievement than the broad trait of Conscientiousness (Chamorro-Premuzic & Furnham, 2003; Paunonen, 1998;
Paunonen & Ashton, 2001).
In this study we test whether the most recently proposed
lower-level Conscientiousness trait of Grit improves criterion
validity in relation to school success outcomes over the broad Conscientiousness domain. Grit was proposed as a Conscientiousnessrelated trait that combines consistency of interests and persistence
in pursuit of long-term goals (Duckworth et al., 2007). The conceptualization of Grit as a lower-level trait in the Conscientiousness
domain is supported both conceptually – with persistence being
a component of Grit and emerging as a facet of Conscientiousness
in some analyses (e.g., Hough & Ones, 2001; MacCann et al., 2009) –
and also based on measurement overlap. A self-report scale assessing Grit asks questions about typical everyday behavior in relation
to achievement goals (e.g., ‘‘I am a hard worker’’ and ‘‘New ideas
and projects sometimes distract me from previous ones’’;
Duckworth & Quinn, 2009; Duckworth et al., 2007), similar to
assessment of Conscientiousness (e.g., ‘‘Tends to be lazy’’, reversed,
and ‘‘Perseveres until the task is finished’’ on the Big Five Inventory
Conscientiousness scale; John et al., 2008).
Grit predicted achievement-related outcomes, such as GPA and
retention in the United States Military Academy (Duckworth et al.,
2007), and it predicted academic success after controlling for educational aspirations and prior achievement (Strayhorn, 2013). In
spite of its high correlation with Conscientiousness (rs between
.70 and .77), Grit was a unique predictor of highest educational
degree obtained and rankings in the National Spelling Bee
(Duckworth & Quinn, 2009). The present paper contributes to the
understanding of this newly proposed self-regulation trait by
examining its predictive validity in relation to outcomes of high
school success, as well as testing its discriminant and incremental
validity in relation to the broad trait of Conscientiousness.
1.2. Emotion Regulation Ability in prediction of school success
In addition to willingness to work hard, school success requires
the ability to regulate emotions associated with social interactions
and achievement-related experiences. Emotion regulation involves
processes of monitoring and modifying emotional reactions in
order to reach a goal, which can happen at any point in the emotion process, from selecting situations, changing situation appraisals, to modulating physiological and behavior reactions (Gross,
1998). Emotion regulation is necessary when one’s experienced
emotions are distressing (e.g., when test anxiety can interfere with
performance) or when they are positive, but distracting or overwhelming (e.g., when one cannot focus in class anticipating an
exciting weekend trip). Successful emotion regulation involves
understanding the consequences of different reactions in emotion-laden situations and having knowledge of effective strategies
(Brackett et al., 2011).
Emotion regulation can be conceptualized in terms of typical
behavior – people’s tendency to use different emotion regulation
strategies on a daily basis – and also in terms of maximal performance – people’s capacity to reason about and identify effective
strategies for influencing emotions. This distinction between typical and maximal performance is often made when comparing personality traits (defined as typical performance, how people
generally behave) and intelligence (defined as maximal performance on ability tests; Goff & Ackerman, 1992). An example of
emotion regulation conceptualized in terms of typical performance is the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (Gross & John,
2003), which measures people’s tendency to engage in cognitive
reappraisal and expressive suppression on a daily basis. The questionnaire items are similar to those on personality trait inventories
and ask how much respondents agree with statement like: ‘‘When
I want to feel less negative emotion, I change the way I am
thinking about the situation’’ (reappraisal) or ‘‘When I am feeling
negative emotions, I make sure not to express them’’ (expressive
suppression).
In this paper, we conceptualize ERA as maximal performance
by measuring it with an ability test that describes hypothetical emotion-laden situations and asks respondents to evaluate
the efficacy of different strategies in reaching a specified goal
(Brackett et al., 2011). Defined as maximal performance, ERA is a
component of emotional intelligence and distinct from personality
traits (Brackett & Mayer, 2003; Day & Carroll, 2004). Across studies,



reasons of participant recruitment. These practical considerations
in individual studies make it more important to accumulate results
from multiple samples that can then be subjected to metaanalyses.
Another limitation of the present study is conceptual in nature.
We compared typical performance traits (Conscientiousness, Grit)
that describe regulation of behavior across a variety of goal situations with the maximal performance attribute of ERA that is specific to modulation of behavior in emotionally charged situations.
It can be argued though that in the context of school performance
this is a relevant comparison. Academic goals and outcomes are
commonly associated with discrete emotions (e.g., attainment of
mastery goals is related to hope and pride; Perkun, Elliot, &
Maier, 2006) and therefore self-regulation in pursuit of these goals
occurs in emotionally charged situations and necessitates influencing emotions. Emotions are regulated when deciding whether to
take a challenging course, when experiencing a conflict between
one’s desire to go out with friends or study for a test, or when having to work hard on a task which one does not enjoy.
How can we predict school success? The present paper showed
independent power of two distinct sets of self-regulation predictors – a typical performance self-regulation trait (Conscientiousness) and maximal performance emotion problem-solving ability
(ERA). Self-regulation traits address the typical style of behavior
(tendency to work hard, be reliable, thorough and persistent),
while ERA involves the maximal capacity to influence one’s emotional reactions in order to reach a goal. The results did not support
incremental validity of Grit, a lower-level self-regulation trait, in
predicting school success beyond Conscientiousness. Finally, the
results also have practical implications for what programs, curricula and interventions get developed to aid educators to enable students to achieve the most. Instead of focusing on lower-level traits,
such as Grit, educational programs should aim to develop a broad
set of Conscientiousness-related behaviors, as well as a rich repertoire of emotion-regulation strategies to address challenging
school experiences.
